*cough cough* Ah, you've made it here, at last.$
My name is Fujin, God of the Wind and Air.$
I have grown old and weary, and yet the music you play has filled me with life.
I could never be more thankful for what you have done here today.$
*cough cough* However, you arent done yet, and you have very little time.$
My song will give you the power to cover great distances.$
With it, find Amatsu-Mikaboshi on the top of this mountain. 
Awaken her, and you can finally rest.
