Nameless Goze of Old, you have my gratitude.
I am Kuraokami, God of Water and Rain. 
You have awoken me from my slumber, and for that I am thankful.
My brethren of Earth, Air and Sky have all befallen a similar fate. 
Please, you must aid them.
My song will help you clear new heights, and overcome obstacles.
Hurry! You must complete your task, lest you fall asleep again.
