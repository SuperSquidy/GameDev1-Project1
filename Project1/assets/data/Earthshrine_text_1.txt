It's about time you came around!  
Some of us doubted, but you have exceeded our expectations.
I am Kuebiko, God of Agriculture and Knowledge.
I was also the god that chose to bring you back to life.
You've made outstanding progress, but there is still more.
You have to reach Fujin and Amatsu before your time runs out. 
In order to reach them, you will need my aid.
Use my song, and even the plants around you will aid you.
Good luck traveller, may your journey be successful...
