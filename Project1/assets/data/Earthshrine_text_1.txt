It's about time you came around! 
That melodramatic god of raindrops didnt think a human could actually awaken the gods.
I am Kuebiko, God of Agriculture and Knowledge
I was also the god that chose to bring you back to life.
Its good to see that my faith in you was well founded, but time is short.
You have to reach Fujin and Amatsu before your time runs out. 
Those old coots should be even further up the mountain, but the path is perilous.
Use my song, and even the plants around you will aid your journey.

Good luck traveller, may your journey be successful...
