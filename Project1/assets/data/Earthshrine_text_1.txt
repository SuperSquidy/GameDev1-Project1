It's about time you came around! 
That melodramatic god of raindrops didnt think
a human could actually awaken the gods.

I am Kuebiko, God of Agriculture and Knowledge,
and the god that chose to bring you back to life.

Its good to see that my faith in you was well founded,
but we don't have much time left to talk. 
You have to reach Fujin and Amatsu before your time runs out
If you don't, they will be lost forever. 
Those old coots should be even further up the mountain,
but you will need my song to get to any of their shrines.

Good luck traveller, may your journey be successful...
