It's about time you came around! 
Some of us doubted, but you have exceeded our expectations.$
I am Kuebiko, God of Agriculture and Knowledge,
and the god that chose to bring you back to life.$
You've made outstanding progress, but there is still more.
You have to reach Fujin and Amatsu before your time runs out.$ 
Use my song, and even the plants around you will aid you.$
Good luck traveller, and may your journey be successful...
