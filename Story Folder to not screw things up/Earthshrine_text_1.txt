It's about time you came around! That 
melodramatic god of raindrops didnt think
a human could actually awaken the gods.

I am Kuebiko, God of Agriculture and Knowledge,
and the god that chose to bring you back to life.

Its good to see that my faith in you was well founded,
but we don't have much time left to talk. You have to reach
Fujin and Amatsu before your time runs out, or they will be
lost forever. Those old coots should be even further up the
mountain, but be warned, without my song, you won't have a 
chance at reaching them. 

Good luck traveller, may your journey be successful...
