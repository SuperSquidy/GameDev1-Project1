Nameless Goze of Old, you have my gratitude.

I am Kuraokami, God of Water and Rain.
You have saved me, but
my brethren of Earth, Air and Sky are
all still in danger. Please, I implore you,
save them.

My Hymn of Rain will help you brave the trials ahead,
now hurry! You must complete your task, before
you fall asleep again...
