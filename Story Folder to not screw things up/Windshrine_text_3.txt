*cough cough* Ah, you've made it, at last.

My name is Fujin, God of the Wind and Air.
I have grown old and weary, and yet the notes 
you play has filled me with life. I could never
be more thankful for what you have done here today.

*cough cough* However, you arent done yet, and you
have very little time. Find Amatsu-Mikaboshi on the
top of this mountain. Awaken her, and you can finally
rest...
