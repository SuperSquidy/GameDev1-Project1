You have finally made it, you whom we have chosen to 
restore the world.
The years have been painful, as humanity fades away
into a distant memory, and we grew weaker by the day.
We found you, oh Nameless Goze, and brought you back
from the grave. And so, just as we had breathed life into you, 
you brought us music and hope. 

I, Amatsu-Mikaboshi, Goddess of the Stars, thank you
for completing a task that most would have considered 
impossible.
Rest now, for you have brought this world a service
that could never be repaid...
