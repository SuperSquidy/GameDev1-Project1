You have finally made it, you whom we have chosen to 
restore the world.
The years have been painful, as more and more people have
seemed to forget about us, pushing us to the brink of 
nonexistance.

Just as we had breathed life into you, you brought
us music and life back to us, and we could never be 
more grateful for what you've done. 

I, Amatsu-Mikaboshi, Goddess of the Stars, thank you
for completing what most would have considered impossible.
Rest now, for you have brought this world a service
that could never be repayed...
